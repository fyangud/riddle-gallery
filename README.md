This web app is created for a company event, which invited people to share their riddles and collect those riddles in a gallery. As shown in the framework sketch, the web app has 3 major components:

Homepage: Displaying welcome text and event information
Riddle submission page: Allowing user to input their riddle contents, then submit those to the database
Gallery: Retrieving and displaying all the riddles that users submitted, allowing users to switch between random and chronological display mode

By using PHP and MySQL, a content management system is used to collect, store and display the riddles that users submitted. Users are also able to react to a riddle by clicking the 'like' button, then data is sent to the database through Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
